# The Pioneers of Artificial Intelligence
A pioneer of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is someone who laid the groundwork for the field by introducing key ideas, theories, or technologies that shaped how machines can simulate human intelligence. For example, Alan Turing proposed the concept of a “universal machine” and created the Turing Test to measure machine intelligence, while John McCarthy coined the term “Artificial Intelligence” in 1956 and Marvin Minsky developed early AI programs. Their contributions established the foundations that modern AI systems still build upon today.
